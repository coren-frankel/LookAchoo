# *LookAchoo*
> LookAchoo is a Geolocation Sneeze Context OSS app constructed in MERN stack. Through a chain of public API calls it identifies the users' IP address and by IP Geolocation then augments real-time weather conditions, air quality, and COVID-19 statical data to inform users about local factors and how to respond to their discomfort.

LookAchoo is a bad pun. But the name draws on a simple verb and a multi-lingual onomatopoeia; focusing on the interwoven relationships like -->

## Features
<!-- List the ready features here: -->
- IP Geolocation upon acknowledgment of innocence in its use
- Conditional and dynamic rendering of images, text, & component styles
- Random assignment of background video sources and **Sniffle-Blurbs** openers
- Random retrieval of up to 10 **Sniffle-Blurbs**‚Ñ¢ from the database (Invoked a "time-to-live" ‚ò†Ô∏è ([TTL](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/expire-data/)) feature to the collection, configurated to purge data entries that have surpassed 24 hours)
- Puns and other inorganic attempts at word-play and wit
- Material Icon "Tooltip" components wrap the carousel of **Sniffle-Blurbs**, revealing hidden plain-text quantified condition levels, which are otherwise highlighted with color by severity (None: Grey, and from Low: Bright Yellow to High: Deep Red)
- Anonymity, no ads, simple yet vibrant User Interface built with the finest MUI components that a beginner can tinker with first...
- Synthesization of materials and links to resources regarding health science educates the user and rationalizes LookAchoo's focus points
- I ain't finished, heck. Reach out if you want to fork the repo and refactor/contribute/collaborate!

## Room for Improvement
<!-- Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development. -->

Room for improvement:
- The experience should not be limited to unreliable IP Geolocation, open up to form search for city, state/region, and perhpas Zipcode. One challenge is to maintain/improve the current consistency of the user experience globally due to the inconsistencies in location data entries between services. That's open source **sucka**!
- The early vision for LookAchoo included mold and dust "ratings" or statistics quantified by weather and climate conditions analysis or clever math. 
- Open LookAchoo up to "sniffle forecasts" by exploiting more additional endpoints with its collection of APIs.
- In it's deployment to vercel the client(frontend) and server(backend) are entangled--as the client is anchored at the root of the project directory and the server anchor is therefore nested in the client deployment. (easy fix ü§û)

To do:
- "Deintegrate" server and client deployments (Only nested in github vercel integration)
- Refactor for accessibility
- Build component(s) that evaluates and qualifies coditions for dust & mold spore displacement
- Potentially open up to forecasts (Some APIs would require upgrade to üí∞paidüôÑ subscriptions)
